IXD301: Designing User Experiences
==================================

The Designing User Experiences module covers a lot of ground, but – good news – it maps over to the other Year 2, Semester 2 module Creative Entrepreneurship. If you work cleverly and creatively the two modules can inform each other and, in fact, they should.

Both of these modules explore the growing field of User Experience (UX). They encourage the creation of delightful user experiences, stressing the need to map out considered user journeys that are fit for purpose, meeting users’ needs.

The module will focus on creating simple weather-related web app that will teache you about the various tools, techniques and technologies involved in UX.
