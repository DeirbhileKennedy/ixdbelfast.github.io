IXD301: Designing User Experiences
==================================

The [Designing User Experiences](http://ixdbelfast.org/curriculum/0002/01/01/designing-user-experiences.html) module covers a lot of ground, but – good news – it maps over to the other Year 2, Semester 1 module [Narrative and Storytelling](http://ixdbelfast.org/curriculum/0002/02/02/creative-entrepreneurship.html). If you work cleverly and creatively the two modules can inform each other and, in fact, they should.

Both of these modules explore the growing field of User Experience (UX). They encourage the creation of delightful user experiences, stressing the need to map out considered user journeys that are fit for purpose, meeting users’ needs.

The module will focus on creating simple weather-related web app that will teach you about the various tools, techniques and technologies involved in UX.

Week 01 - Introduction
----------------------

### Weather App
The Weather App carries the majority of the weight on marks for this module and will include:
1. Name and brand design
2. Icon design
3. Consideration for cross device application
4. Working prototypes (Keynote, InVision, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, APIs)
5. Connected product concepts

Rather than creating a generic ‘catch-all’ weather app, consider a specific target audience for your product. You might create something that teaches primary school children about the weather and climate change. Alternatively you might target it at adrenalin junkies hell-bound on catching the next [F5 tornado](http://tornado-facts.com/the-tornado-scale/). Maybe you want to know what the weather conditions are like on Saturn or Neptune. 

### Masterclass
Chris will introduce JavaScript on this week-long masterclass*.

*Before Week 08 you must have completed the JavaScript and jQuery classes on [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com)

Week 02 - Idea Generation, User Personas 
----------------------------------------

In our second week we took another look at idea generation, focusing on [mind mapping](http://www.tonybuzan.com/about/mind-mapping/), divergent thinking and alogical connections to help develop lots of ideas for possible digital products based on the theme of weather.

**Don't forget to sign up to [InVision's Education Edition](http://www.invisionapp.com/education-signup)**. You should have education access code, if not, drop me a line.

We ran through user personas again and discussed the importance of conducting focussed user research to ensure the product is developed for the right audience. Making these personas as realistic as possible, through user research, brainstorming, refining and condensing will allow us to develop more successful product.

We also considered the importance of touchpoints, onboarding and customer journeys. We explored the different areas of a user journey, and how users make their way through an app or web site. When we first launch an app, whether it’s native or a web app, there’s an [empty state](http://emptystat.es/). We need to provide clues, like a trail of metaphorical breadcrumbs, showing the way. This needs to be designed too.

We also touched on [calls to action](https://boagworld.com/design/10-techniques-for-an-effective-call-to-action/), looking at how we can attract user to our product. Everything's a journey and we need to consider every single step our customers are likely to take through that journey from the initial sign up to final sign off.

Week 03 Customer Journeys
=========================

We looked at Customer Journeys in more detail this week. While last week we covered onboarding techniques, this week we considered the equally important approach to offboarding. Managed well, it can strenghten a company’s reputation and help build their brand. Approached badly and it can do untold damage – a look at the examples on the [Dark Patterns](darkpatterns.org/) will give you lots of food for thought.

As a we saw, a user journey is a path a user may take to reach their goal when using a particular website or app. These user journeys are used when designing websites or apps, to identify the different methods of enabling the user to achieve their goal as quickly and easily as possible.

A useful exercise to evaluate the effectiveness of your user experience is to pit it against another site or product that is offering the same service. We compared how gov.uk and gov.ie both handled the same tasks with differing results.


[gov.uk Digital Service Standard’s](https://www.gov.uk/design-principles) won the 2013 Design Museum's Design of the Year award. In the same year the won a coveted D&AD Black Pencil in the Writing for Design / Writing for Websites & Digital Design category.
