IXD301: Designing User Experiences
==================================

The [Designing User Experiences](http://ixdbelfast.org/curriculum/0002/01/01/designing-user-experiences.html) module covers a lot of ground, but – good news – it maps over to the other Year 2, Semester 1 module [Narrative and Storytelling](http://ixdbelfast.org/curriculum/0002/02/02/creative-entrepreneurship.html). If you work cleverly and creatively the two modules can inform each other and, in fact, they should.

Both of these modules explore the growing field of User Experience (UX). They encourage the creation of delightful user experiences, stressing the need to map out considered user journeys that are fit for purpose, meeting users’ needs.

The module will focus on creating simple weather-related web app that will teach you about the various tools, techniques and technologies involved in UX.

Week 01 - Introduction
----------------------

### Weather App
The Weather App carries the majority of the weight on marks for this module and will include:
1. Name and brand design
2. Icon design
3. Consideration for cross device application
4. Working prototypes (Keynote, InVision, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, APIs)
5. Connected product concepts

Rather than creating a generic ‘catch-all’ weather app, consider a specific target audience for your product. You might create something that teaches primary school children about the weather and climate change. Alternatively you might target it at adrenalin junkies hell-bound on catching the next [F5 tornado](http://tornado-facts.com/the-tornado-scale/). Maybe you want to know what the weather conditions are like on Saturn or Neptune. 

### Masterclass
Chris will introduce JavaScript on this week-long masterclass*.

*Before Week 08 you must have completed the JavaScript and jQuery classes on [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com)

Week 02 - Idea Generation, User Personas, Customer Journeys
--------------------------------------------------------------

In our second week we took another look at idea generation, focusing on [mind mapping](http://www.tonybuzan.com/about/mind-mapping/), divergent thinking and alogical connections to help develop lots of ideas for possible digital products based on the theme of weather.

**Don't forget to sign up to [InVision's Education Edition](http://www.invisionapp.com/education-signup)**. You should have education access code, if not, drop me a line.

We ran through user personas again and discussed the importance of conducting focussed user research to ensure the product is developed for the right audience. Making these personas as realistic as possible, through user research, brainstorming, refining and condensing will allow us to develop more successful product.

We also considered the importance of touchpoints, onboarding and customer journeys. We explored the different areas of a user journey, and how users make their way through an app or web site. When we first launch an app, whether it’s native or a web app, there’s an [empty state](http://emptystat.es/). We need to provide clues, like a trail of metaphorical breadcrumbs, showing the way. This needs to be designed too.

We also touched on [calls to action](https://boagworld.com/design/10-techniques-for-an-effective-call-to-action/), looking at how we can attract user to our product. Everything's a journey and we need to consider every single step our customers are likely to take through that journey from the initial sign up to final sign off.
