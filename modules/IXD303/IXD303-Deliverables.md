IXD303: Deliverables
====================

This page is designed to give you a clear breakdown of the deliverables expected for the module. There are two deliverables:

+ Deliverable 01 - Weather Web App + Masterclass (60%)
+ Deliverable 02 - Research, Discovery and Supporting Material (40%)

The expectation is that the prototypes you create for Deliverable 2, will inform your final design for Deliverable 1.

## Deliverable 01
#### Weather App
The Weather App carries the majority of the weight on marks for this module and will include:
1. Name and brand design
2. Icon design
3. Consideration for cross device application
4. Working prototypes (Keynote, InVision, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, APIs)
5. Connected product concepts

#### Masterclass
Chris will introduce JavaScript on this week-long masterclass*.

*Before Week 08 you must have completed the JavaScript and jQuery classes on [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com)
