IXD 301 Designing with Content
======================

This module explores the importance of considering content – in all its forms – as a core element of any piece of interaction design that can, itself, be designed. As content strategist Karen McGrane puts it: “Well-structured content is the backbone and starting point of all successful web designs and user interactions.” Through an emphasis on developing strategic approaches to content and its generation, students are introduced to additional possible career pathways, including that of the content strategist.

Students undertake a series of exercises, which include: identifying content types and taxonomies; designing content systems; considering future, as yet unimagined content delivery platforms; learning the principles of programming; and exploring Content Management Systems (CMS) and two workshops.

Week 01: Briefing and Overview 1 (Portfolio)
--------------------------------------------

Briefing: The first half of the module is focused on portfolio site and content strategy. It's really all about self-promotion. Things to consider:

+ Content Audit
+ Learning from Others (How are your heroes structuring their sites?)
+ Site-Mapping Your Site

This first week is pretty much focused on explaining the shift from static to dynamic content. We will be talking about:

+ Static Site; vs
+ WordPress, Ghost, etc. (Database); vs.
+ Jekyll, Kirby, etc. (Flat File)

We will be doing a Jekyll install and getting you to start looking at this.

Tasks to be done:

+ Perform Content Audit 
+ Create Site 
+ Install Jekyll

Week 02: Masterclass: Micro-Publications
----------------------------------------

At heart we are designers of content. In the absence of content, our role is almost impossible to fulfil. (Lorem ipsum does no one any favours.) This short, intensive masterclass explores how content is changing, or – more accurately – how we consume content is changing.

We’ll be developing concepts for ‘micro-publications’ – short, easy to consume content frgaments – and exploring how these might be packaged, delivered and consumed. Our goal is to create a portfolio piece that might (but needn’t be) developed further.

This is a one day masterclass supplemented with a week to develop and realise ideas. Masterclass on Thursday, deadline the following Wednesday. A short, sharp one week project.

---

Week 03: Wrestling Jekyll
-------------------------

Returning to your portfolio site…

This week is pretty much all about getting the content gathered. Returning to your Week 01 Content Audit and the site map you created, start to generate the content for your site.

We will be considerig 'Where content comes from?'

+ Client
+ Self-Generated
+ Wikipedia or other Third Party Sites
+ User Generated Content

We will also be looking at the power of Jekyll with includes, data, header and footer etc.

Today is pretty much about getting GitHub Pages and Jekyll running. 

Tasks to be done:

+ Get dirty with Jekyll
+ Consider how your site will piece together, header, footer etc
+ Consider the look and feel of the site, paper prototypes, wireframes and style tiles please.

---

Week 04: Where Content Comes From
---------------------------------

This week is all about where content comes from and also who owns that content. We'll look at sources of content, for example:

+ Client Supplied
+ Self Generated
+ User Generated Content
+ APIs
+ Etc.

Once we've identified different sources of content we'll look at who owns what. We're really underlining that you can't just raid Google for images and use them with abandon. We'll explore:

+ Copyright
+ Creative Commons

We'll also identify different sources of imagery, etc., for example  Illustration, Icons, Photography…

+ Illustration
  + iStockPhoto
  + Others?
+ Icons
  + The Noun Project
+ Photography
  + Unsplash
  + iStockPhoto
  + Shutterstock
  + Getty

Tasks to be done:

+ Start to consider the content for your site, portfolio pieces, case studies the actual words
+ You should have by now wireframed and paper prototype your sites.  Into development mode you go!

---

Week 05: If a tree falls in the forest…
---------------------------------------

Great, you've built a site, now how are you going to promote it? Look at the Storytelling and Social Media keynote.  We also need the Venn diagram, again I have this… The three-pronged approach:

1. Portfolio Site
2. Social Profiles (Twitter, Instagram, etc.)
3. Inspiration and Priming the Brain (Tumblr, Pinterest, etc.)

This week is really all about developing a strategy and connecting with people online in preparation for placement. Maybe a Twitter Starter?

+ [Core Systems](https://twitter.com/coresystemstech)
+ [David Henderson Design](https://twitter.com/weareDHD)

Get the students to start strategically following and interacting. Also stress:

+ Don't be a dick.
+ Spelling and Grammar
+ What's appropriate?

---

Week 06: Group Critique (Portfolio Sites)
-----------------------------------------

What we are looking to see here is two deliverables:

+ Your portfolio site complete and online
+ Your Micro-publications 

This ends the portfolio project.

---

Week 07: Briefing and Overview 2 (Elements)
-------------------------------------------

This week is about outlining the next project, the 'Elements' site. We will look at some of the best projects from last year: Andrew Whann; Taj Rahman; Inga Hampton.

## Project Requirements

+ A branded homepage containing your version of the periodic table
+ At least five additional element pages aimed at the 12–14 year old audience **OR** At least five element page aimed at undergraduate chemistry student.
+ A style guide to accompany design
+ The delivery platform for this project is Jekyll

I will  give you the raw content, which you will be organising in a spreadsheet. Talk about taxonomies, explain what we mean by considering different content types. 

Tasks to be done:

+ Spreadsheet Excercise for Elements Website
+ Short excercise design one element as a poster
+ Begin to consider the paper prototypes, sketches and wireframes
+ Consider moodboards and style tiles for project
+ [Visit the Ulster Mueseum - Periodic Table Exhibition](https://nmni.com/um/What-s-on/Elements)

Week 08: Masterclass (Orchestrating Content)
--------------------------------------------

This is a one day masterclass supplemented with a week to develop and realise ideas. Masterclass on Thursday, deadline the following Wednesday. A short, sharp one week project.

---

Week 09: Who's it for?
----------------------

This week is all about users and user personas. We'll get them to create a couple of user personas for the Elements web site and show how these personas will require different things.

###Persona A - A Child (8-10)

What are they interested in? Is this to do with teaching? Is it fun? Is it serious? Is it gamified? IMPORTANT: Are we leaving some of the content out, because it's not appropriate to the audience, for example the atomic weight might be a bit boring.

###Persona B - An Undergraduate (18-22)

A different kind of person, different kind of needs. This person might want the atomic weight (in fact they might need it).

Stress that the different personas will lead to different outcomes and that *before we begin to design something* we need to think about who is using it and what their needs are.

Tasks to be done:

+ A persona for your project
+ Consider doing some research, a questionnaire to a primary school?
+ CVs for Placement

---


Week 10: The Art of the Pitch
-----------------------------

**There has been a change of plan and we wont be doing pitch presentations in Week 12 just a normal crit.  We will still be going over how to pitch as you will do this in semester two.**

**Neverthless this doesnt mean you take early holidays you should be cracking away on the elements project.**

Everything you need to know about selling your ideas. How to design a slick slide deck and present it.	

Tasks to be done:

+ Sketch out your 5 minute slide deck.
+ What is your story regarding the elements site?
+ Who is it for?
+ Why is it designed in this way?




---

Week 11: Future Friendly Content
--------------------------------

Today is about the future.

We always need to spend time on the HTML… Everything else is icing on the cake.

Content that is well marked up lasts longer. In terms of ability to open in 20 years time… The items lower down the list are likely to pose problems (often because they are proprietary solutions):

+ Plain Text
+ Plain Text + Markdown * (Markdown is a bonus!)
+ HTML
+ HTML + CSS *
+ HTML + CSS + JS *
+ WordPerfect
+ Etc.

\* Markdown, CSS and JS are bonuses.

We will talk about Future Friendly design and watch Jeremy Keith's talk on Resilience:
