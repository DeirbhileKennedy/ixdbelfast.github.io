IXD102 - Introduction to Communication Design
====================

----

In this module we introduce students to the history of communication design. Starting with imagined communication devices of the future (Minority Report, Prometheus…) we rewind, in a single lecture, to the era of cave painting (Lascaux, Chauvet…), demonstrating the connections that bind human communication together.

For a more in-depth explanation of the module’s intent, including recommended reading, read the [abbreviated module descriptor](http://ixdbelfast.org/curriculum/0001/01/02/introduction-to-communication-design.html). (This module is run concurrently for students on both the BDes (Hons) Interaction Design and BSc (Hons) Interactive Multimedia Design courses.)

## Week 01 - Introduction and Reverse History

**Friday 29th September 2017**


The value of a solid knowledge and understanding of the history of design cannot be understated. As Confucius wisely said 

>“Study the past if you would define the future.”

Otherwise, if you know what came before you will be better equipped to design for whatever is to come. No one can work effectively in a creative vacuum. Fact.

If [Dieter Rams](https://www.vitsoe.com/gb/about/dieter-rams) hadn’t come across the [Ulm School of Design](http://www.hfg-archiv.ulm.de/english) he may never have developed his iconic design for the [Braun Radio](http://www.eyemagazine.com/blog/post/designing-for-dieter-rams) and if [Jonathan Ive](https://www.apple.com/uk/pr/bios/jonathan-ive.html) wasn’t aware of Rams he wouldn’t have designed the first iMac, iPod and the current range of Apple products we all know and love (or hate).

We looked at [Guillermo del Toro](http://www.fastcocreate.com/3020262/master-class/guillermo-del-toro-shares-14-horror-insights-from-his-spectacular-sketch-book) and saw how a knowledge and appreciation of past artists has helped him develop the fascinating creatures in the movies such as [Pan’s Labrynth](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0457430) and [Pacific Rim](http://www.pacificrimmovie.com).

While not an accessible aspect of the course you should try to keep a weekly journal of your thoughts and progress on this and the other modules. It will help you rationalise what is covered and will provide a vehicle in which you can refer back to when you need to research material for future projects. It will also show us and potential employers that you are interested and engaged.

### Project 01
Your first project for this module is to create a [Type Specimen Poster](https://uk.pinterest.com/jsgore/typography-type-specimen-posters/) based on **one** of the fonts.

- Jenson
- Bembo
- Garamond
- Caslon
- Baskerville
- Bodoni
- Akzindenz-Grotesk

You poster should be A3 (420mm x 297mm) and ideally created in Adobe Illustrator or Photoshop, alternatively you may use [Sketch](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/) (students can avail of a 50% discount for this excellent product). If you are not familiar with any of these yet don't panic. You could use (and it pains me to say this) Microsoft Word until you get to grips with the former. 

The poster should be posted to your webspace (IMD) or your GitHub site (IxD) **there is no need to print anything**. Don't worry if you don't have either up and running yet just save what you have until you're ready to upload it.

Research the subject to get a handle on what a type specimen poster should look like (you could even write a little blog post on the subject) before putting **pencil to paper**. Don't just rely on the links we provide, find your own material. As with any creative project **always, always, always** start on paper **never** jump straight onto a computer, you will never create anything meaningful this way.

You poster should obviously feature your chosen font but you should also include a couple of paragraphs on the designer who created the font, give us a little background to who they are and what else they may have created. Don't worry if you don't have access to the fonts, use one that looks closest to it.

If you have any questions don't hesitate to get in touch.

**Completion Date: Friday 12th October 2015** 

Rather than take a look through these in Week 04 I will leave the first feedback session until Week 07 when we can look at the first two projects (two posters for IMD and one for IxD (IxD have a group project instead of the second poster)) this will give everyone time to reflect on the first project and improve on things if necessary. 

### Friday IxD Seminar

*If Markdown is not covered on the course, IMD Students are free to complete these tasks too.*

To kick things off we introduced two essential tools any self-respecting interaction designer should be familiar with. 

If you don't have a preferred text editor, you should download yourself a copy of [Brackets](http://brackets.io) and, using the text in the attachment below, set what you see into [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics). If you are new to Markdown there is a great online tutorial at - [markdowntutorial.com](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/)

You should mark the headings, paragraphs, lists, etc as you see fit. Keep a copy of what you have created and once we get you up and running on GitHub you can upload it there or alternatively you can post it on Tumblr now.

Download the attached [Markdown Exercise](resources/markdown_exercise.zip) **- right-click and save the zip file to your computer -** and, using the PDF as a guide set the markdown_raw.rtf file into Markdown. You won’t be able to match the PDF exactly (this will come later with the aid of the magic of CSS) but set it as you see fit using Markdown in Brackets (or your own preferred text editor).
