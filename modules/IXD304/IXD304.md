IXD304 Creative Entrepreneurship
================================

This module introduces students to the ideas and principles, which underpin creative entrepreneurship, placing a heavy focus on the emerging and rapidly growing field of digital product design.

Through a focus on companies and individuals that have built digital products – from the very large (for example, global tools like Facebook and Twitter) to the very small (for example, sole designers developing products like icons and typefaces) – students are encouraged to develop an entrepreneurial mindset.

Week 01 – An Introduction to Entrepreneurship
---------------------------------------------

So, what makes an entrepreneur?

>"The critical ingredient is getting off your butt and doing something. It’s as simple as that. A lot of people have ideas, but there are few who decide to do something about them now. Not tomorrow. Not next week. But today. The true entrepreneur is a doer, not a dreamer.”
<cite>Nolan Bushnell, Entrepreneur</cite>

The term entrepreneur, in part has come to mean *someone who has his or her own startup or business*. The difference between an entrepreneur and a small business lies in the income generated. Where a small business may generate an income that may replace traditional employment an entrepreneur will generate substantial wealth. This wealth is often created much quicker than traditional business methods, a five year span isn’t unusual. 

According to [Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/aileron/2013/11/26/the-top-skills-every-entrepreneur-needs/#238a57ee5669), the skills every successful entrepreneur have in common are:
- **Resiliency** – The ability to weather the ups and downs 
- **Focus** - After setting a long term vision, knowing how to “laser focus” on the very next step to get closer to the ultimate goal.
- **Invest** - For the long-term. Most entrepreneurs are not patient and focus only on what comes next, rather than where the company needs to go. 
- **Find and manage people** - They need to learn to network to meet the right people.
- **Sell** - Every entrepreneur is a sales person whether they want to be or not. They are either selling their ideas, products or services to customers, investors or employees.
- **Learn** - Successful entrepreneurs realize they don’t know everything and the market is constantly changing. They stay up to date on new systems, technology, and industry trends.
- **Self-reflection** - Allow downtime to reflect on the past and plan for the future.
- **Self-reliance** - While there is a lot of help for the entrepreneur, in the end, they need to be resourceful enough to depend on themselves.

####Your home is on the web  
To get the best placements (and the best jobs when you graduate) you need to be able to present yourself as effectively as possible. One of the first places to start should be your website. Without a web presence you will be all but invisible.

####Learn from the professionals
The keyword here is *learn*. Look, but don’t copy, therein lies the road to a *lot* of trouble. We will look at issues around copyright and plagiarism in **Who Owns What** later in the semester but in the meantime, feel free to draw inspiration from the resources you find but make sure your website is exactly that. 100% yours.

**We looked at:**

- [Personal Page by Naz Hamid](https://github.com/weightshift/The-Personal-Page)   
- [Fieldwork](http://madebyfieldwork.com) and
- [Marco Grimaldi](http://www.thenerodesign.com)

*Importantly **find your own inspiration** and preferably from places other than **One Page Love** or **Awwwards** or a Google search of the best portfolio sites of 2017. These sites, and lots like them, can be useful, but your site will just end up a clone of everyone elses. This is your time to shine, to show what makes you stand out from the crowd.

The [net awards](https://thenetawards.com/vote) is a great place to find real talent. Where categories such as [Young Designer of the Year](https://thenetawards.com/vote/young-designer) and [Young Developer of the Year](https://thenetawards.com/vote/young-developer) celebrate the next generation of talent. Who knows, some of you could be here in time to come!
