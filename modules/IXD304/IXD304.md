IXD304 Creative Entrepreneurship
================================

This module introduces students to the ideas and principles, which underpin creative entrepreneurship, placing a heavy focus on the emerging and rapidly growing field of digital product design.

Through a focus on companies and individuals that have built digital products – from the very large (for example, global tools like Facebook and Twitter) to the very small (for example, sole designers developing products like icons and typefaces) – students are encouraged to develop an entrepreneurial mindset.

Week 01 – An Introduction to Entrepreneurship
---------------------------------------------

So, what makes an entrepreneur?

>"The critical ingredient is getting off your butt and doing something. It’s as simple as that. A lot of people have ideas, but there are few who decide to do something about them now. Not tomorrow. Not next week. But today. The true entrepreneur is a doer, not a dreamer.”
<cite>Nolan Bushnell, Entrepreneur</cite>

The term entrepreneur, in part has come to mean *someone who has his or her own startup or business*. The difference between an entrepreneur and a small business lies in the income generated. Where a small business may generate an income that may replace traditional employment an entrepreneur will generate substantial wealth. This wealth is often created much quicker than traditional business methods, a five year span isn’t unusual. 

According to [Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/aileron/2013/11/26/the-top-skills-every-entrepreneur-needs/#238a57ee5669), the skills every successful entrepreneur have in common are:
- **Resiliency** – The ability to weather the ups and downs 
- **Focus** - After setting a long term vision, knowing how to “laser focus” on the very next step to get closer to the ultimate goal.
- **Invest** - For the long-term. Most entrepreneurs are not patient and focus only on what comes next, rather than where the company needs to go. 
- **Find and manage people** - They need to learn to network to meet the right people.
- **Sell** - Every entrepreneur is a sales person whether they want to be or not. They are either selling their ideas, products or services to customers, investors or employees.
- **Learn** - Successful entrepreneurs realize they don’t know everything and the market is constantly changing. They stay up to date on new systems, technology, and industry trends.
- **Self-reflection** - Allow downtime to reflect on the past and plan for the future.
- **Self-reliance** - While there is a lot of help for the entrepreneur, in the end, they need to be resourceful enough to depend on themselves.

#### Your home is on the web  
To get the best placements (and the best jobs when you graduate) you need to be able to present yourself as effectively as possible. One of the first places to start should be your website. Without a web presence you will be all but invisible.

#### Learn from the professionals
The keyword here is *learn*. Look, but don’t copy, therein lies the road to a *lot* of trouble. We will look at issues around copyright and plagiarism in **Who Owns What** later in the semester but in the meantime, feel free to draw inspiration from the resources you find but make sure your website is exactly that. 100% yours.

**We looked at:**

- [Personal Page by Naz Hamid](https://github.com/weightshift/The-Personal-Page)   
- [Fieldwork](http://madebyfieldwork.com) and
- [Marco Grimaldi](http://www.thenerodesign.com)

*Importantly **find your own inspiration** and preferably from places other than **One Page Love** or **Awwwards** or a Google search of the best portfolio sites of 2017. These sites, and lots like them, can be useful, but your site will just end up a clone of everyone elses. This is your time to shine, to show what makes you stand out from the crowd.

The [net awards](https://thenetawards.com/vote) is a great place to find real talent. Where categories such as [Young Designer of the Year](https://thenetawards.com/vote/young-designer) and [Young Developer of the Year](https://thenetawards.com/vote/young-developer) celebrate the next generation of talent. Who knows, some of you could be here in time to come!

Week 02 – Guest Lecturer
------------------------
This week, Designer and User Experience Expert, [Kyle Gawley](http://kylegawley.co.uk/) talked about his journey from college to university to running his own business.

Covering everything from university coursework to personal projects, he looked at a number of digital products he has created including:
- [Bear CSS](http://bearcss.com/)
- [Groovedeck](http://groovedeck.it/)   
- [Banana Relish](http://bananarelish.com/)
…and of course  
- [Get Invited](https://getinvited.to/)

Week 03 – The Creative Process 
------------------------------

>“Spend time falling in love with things that aren’t design, and let those things influence your work. Inspiration comes from everywhere and all good designers talk about how much they’re inspired by architecture, fine art, books, nature, etc.”
<cite>–Jessica Hische</cite>

The creative process is unique for everyone, there is no single formula for getting ‘into the zone’ and starting those creative juices flowing.

There are however, a few things we can do to help. James Webb Young’s excellent little book, [‘A Technique for Producing Ideas’](http://amzn.to/2lSYV0k) sets out a process that can help us a develop our ideas.

He suggests:

- **1. Gather raw material** – Not just for the project in hand but gather material for everything that interests you. As Hische says in the quote above, ‘inspiration comes from everywhere’, so start gathering.
- **2. Digest what you have gathered** – Once you have exhausted your research, allow time for the material to assimilate.
- **3. Unconscious processing** – Sleep on it and allow your subconscious do the hard work for you.
- **4. Everything clicks into place** – As Young calls it “a-ha! moment” when your idea seemingly comes out of thin air.
- **5. Idea meets reality** – As Young puts it your idea meets “the cold, grey dawn of the morning after,” and has to face reality. This is when you can seek feedback from your peers to check how robust your idea is. 

Of course, on occasions it isn’t as straightworward as this, but over time, and with experience, things will start to click into place.

Establishing a habit that sets you up for creative work, can help get you in the right frame of mind more easily. This could be as simple as sitting at your desk, listening to your favourite music with a mug of coffee. For others it could start with a morning trip to the gym or walking the dog. 

Developing habits prior to starting work helps get the mind ready, it tells the brain, ‘now is the time for creativity, so let’s get on with it!’

[Medium]() is a fantastic source of material on all manner of subjects and you should definitely subscribe to their weekly digest. I had mentioned – [Perfectionism Killed my Productivity](https://medium.com/desk-of-van-schneider/perfectionism-killed-my-productivity-b9240aec5d2f#.8lgtyhacu) by [Tobias van Schneider](http://www.vanschneider.com/) – as one of the posts you should read.

Week 04 – Stand Out From The Crowd
----------------------------------

>“You can be stronger when you are not wanting it, if you just do it out of love and trust, then that is when you find what you are looking for.”
<cite>–Samuel T Herring.</cite>

There are literally hundreds, globally, thousands, of young and up-and-coming designers and developers emerging onto the jobs market every year. In today’s session we asked. **What can you do to stand out from the crowd?**

The common traits you’ll find in everyone who’s successful, is that have a story, they’re creating interesting work and they’re building relationships. Attending events, being active on the web, Twitter, Dribbble, Linkedin, etc, counts. When someone you respect does something great, take a few moments to let them know what you think, it’s a big part of being a good human. And there can never be enough of them.

Our guest lecturer, [Kyle Gawley](http://kylegawley.co.uk/) covered these areas beautifully, breaking them down into five key areas:

### 1. Story

If you’re new and don’t have a story, create a vision and make that your story. 

>‘The things that made you weird as a kid will make you great tomorrow.’
<cite>-James Victore</cite>

This reflects Kyle’s *‘own your own weirdness’* quote perfectly. Those things that make you unique, are the things that will make stand out from the crowd. 

- [Jonny Campbell](http://jonnycampbell.com/)
- [Mr Bingo](http://shop.mr-bingo.org.uk/)
- [Visual Idiot](http://visualidiot.com/)
- [Neil Patel](http://neilpatel.com/)

### 2. Portfolio

We have covered portfolios before but it is always worthwhile looking at it again. As Kyle said:

- Show your best work
- If you can, include testimonials from clients
- Add case studies and show your process

- [Andy McMillan](http://goodonpaper.com/)
- [Paddy Donnelly](http://lefft.com/)
- [Little Thunder](https://littlethunder.co/)
- [Lee Munroe](http://www.leemunroe.com/)

Finally, in this section Kyle suggested creating a clear [call to action](https://boagworld.com/design/10-techniques-for-an-effective-call-to-action/) on your website to make people aware of what you want from them.

### 3. Side/Passion Project

We have mentioned this in the past, but you can’t understate the importance of side projects, or as Jessica Hische calls them, [passion projects](https://github.com/blog/1632-video-passion-projects-talk-5-with-jessica-hische).

These:

- Help to illustrate your passion outside work or university projects.
- Allow you to showcase skills.
- Provide a breathing space from the work you have to do.
- Can feed back into work or university projects.

Some examples are:
- [Big Word Project](http://www.thebigwordproject.com/)
- [Bear CSS](http://bearcss.com/) featured on hacker news and featured in the Web Designers Idea book.
- [Chris Spooner](http://blog.spoongraphics.co.uk/)

### 4. Networking

On networking Kyle talked about:

- Working your connections to make other connections as you never know where they might lead.
- Your best credibility comes when people vouch for you. Recommendations count for a lot in this business (any business).
- Pay it forward. Don’t be the one who always takes. 
- Make sure the people you work with are credible, and reliable.

### 5. Marketing Yourself

Finally Kyle looked at a number of ways in which we can promote ourselves:

- Create content that benefits people in your industry or are targeted at the market you want to gain work from.
- Define your audience and create the type of content they will consume.
- Blogging will help generate traffic.
    - Choose 1-3 channels and spend time to generate valuable content.
    - Consistency is key, blogging 1-2 times a month as a minimum.
    - Tweet 3-4 times a dayand use services such as [Buffer](https://buffer.com/) to help manage the delovery of your content
- Develop a profile and post to [Linkedin](https://linkedin.com/)
- Recycle old content. Sometimes it’s easier to re-work existimg content for a different audience. Look back at previous material to see if you can give it a fresh lease of life.

Week 05 – Who Owns What
-----------------------

You might be creating original works, you might be creating derivative works or you might be appropriating your material. Regardless, it’s important to familiarise yourself with questions of ownership, copyright and issues around plagiarism.

---

Week 07 – Reading Week
----------------------

---

There are no taught classes today but students are expected to continue working on their project material.

---

Week 08 – Digital Pricing Models
----------------------------------

>“As with all matters of pricing, there’s no “one true way”, but there are lots of wrong turns and dead ends. Avoid those and you’re in good shape.”
<cite>– Des Traynor, Intercom</cite>

Pricing your product appropriately ensures that you can reach as wide an audience as possible. Do it right and your product, provided it’s something people want, will be a success. Get it wrong and you are likely to under, or over price yourself out of the market.

### Quality, Price and Demand

It all comes down to the quality of your product and the demand. Apple currently have it right. Their computers may be a lot more expensive than many similar PCs, but people are more than willing to pay more for that perceived quality. That will only last as long as Apple are able to meet consumer demands for a high quality, innovative, reliable product.

Pricing your product all depends on what’s on offer. MailChimp offers volume sales with a tiered pricing structure. Their success depends on companies sending out tens or hundreds of thousands or even millions of emails per month and paying for that service. As the volume increases then so does the monthly cost.

Offering a tiered pricing structure provides people with the option to start low and build up from there. [GitHub’s Pricing Plan](https://github.com/pricing) offers the user a range purchasing option. 

With Free, $7 per mth, $25 per mth and $2,500 per year, GitHub have given themselves a 80/20 chance that people will take up one of the options. With only one option the user is left with a buy or don’t buy option, cutting down that chance of a purchase to 50/50.

### How much should we charge?

Most businesses are eventually faced with the key question: How much should we charge? There is no one true answer.

- Believing everyone should be happy to pay for your product.

- Believing there is some mythical “perfect” price which extracts maximum revenue from every single customer.

- Believing product pricing can never be changed once chosen. 

- Delaying charging indefinitely as a result of 1, 2 and 3.

Other options can include leaving the decision of what to pay up to the customer. [Lost Type](http://www.losttype.com/font/?name=escafina) leave it up to the buyer to pay what they feel the fonts are worth. With a minimum price per font, they are guaranteed enough to cover their own costs.

If you are offering your product for free, rather than simply giving is away, adding a [Pay with a Tweet](https://www.paywithatweet.com/?locale=en) option can reward your hard work with a little more publicity and a wider audience.

Week 09 – Minimum Viable Product
--------------------------------

>“The minimum viable product is that version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort.”
<cite>—Eric Ries</cite>

A plain doughnut, like our minimum viable product offers a small, entry level product to test the market upon which we can scale based on interest. If the market likes it we can add a variety of toppings and flavours to expand our product and reach a wider audience. 

We need to get the core serving of our product right first before we can add more features.

Through the eyes of one of the founders [Joe Gebbia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKxNhkzfTWg), we took a look at how Airbnb grew from a blowup mattress and breakfast in the front room of his shared apartment to the world-wide phenomenon it is today.
